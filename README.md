# Intro To Ruby Iterators

## Outline

1. Explain Iterators vs Loops

  A. methods on objects. Like loops, but for things.
  B. Abstract logic away.

2. Basic `each` example

Calling each on an array. printing Hello. How many times did it print?
creating an iterator to keep track of count and incrementing it in loop and printing count.
using that iterator to print a value from the array.

introduce the yielded member of the array. syntax (do / end and pipes). concept (refer to above).

simple example.

{} syntax

iterators return values

encapsulate other logic

example of another iterator - all?

iterator vs loops can simplify more than just iteration.

example of using a block to transform a method to an iterator - count

summary iterators vs loops, they yield you the elements very easily and can encapsulate a lot of cool logic.
